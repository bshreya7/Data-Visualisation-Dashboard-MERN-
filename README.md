# Data-Visualisation-Dashboard-MERN

The Data Visualization Dashboard employs the MERN Stack to generate visual representations. The project utilizes provided JSON data to establish a MongoDB database and develop a node.js API for data retrieval. Visualizations are crafted using the chart.js library, and the dashboard incorporates multiple filters. The primary objective of the project is to derive meaningful insights through innovative visual representations.
